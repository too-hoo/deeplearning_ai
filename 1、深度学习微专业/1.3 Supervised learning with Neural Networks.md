# Supervised learning with Neural Networks

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having 
the idea that there is a relationship between the input and output.

Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. In a regression 
problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning  that we are trying to map input 
variables to some continuous function. In a classification problems, we are instead trying to predict result in a
discrete(离散) output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.

Here are some examples of supervised learning.

There are different types of neural network, for example Convolution Neural Network(CNN) used often for image 
application and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) used for one-dimentional sequence data such as translating English
to Chinese or a temporal component such as text transcript. As for the autonomous driving, it is a hybrid neural
network architecture.

### Structured vs unstructured data

Structured data refers to things that has a defined meaning such as price, age whereas unstructured data refers to
thing like pixel, raw audio, text.
