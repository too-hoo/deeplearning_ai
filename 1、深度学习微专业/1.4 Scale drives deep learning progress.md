# Why is deep learning taking off?

Deep learning is taking off due to a large amount of data available through the digitization of the society,
faster computation and innovation in the development of neural network algorithm.

开始的时候，由于数据量不是很大和技术不是很先进，发展不起来，后来直到现在才起飞， 数据规模不大的时候，算法svm训练的结果反而更好，但是，
当数据量很大的时候，神经网络是最好的！

Two things have to be considererd to get to the high level of performance:

1. Being able to train a big enough neural network
2. Huge amount of labeled data

- Data

- Computation

- Algorithms

The process of training a neural network is iterative.

- Idea --> Code --> Experiment --> Idea 环状图

It could take a good amount of time to train a neural network, which affects your productivity.Faster computation
helps to iterate and improve new algorithm.
