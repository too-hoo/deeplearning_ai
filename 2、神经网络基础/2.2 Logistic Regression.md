# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a learning algorithm used in a supervised learning problem when the output y are all either 
zero or one. The goal of logistic regression is to minimize the error between its predictions and training data.

## Example: Cat vs No-cat

Given an image represented by a feature vector x, the algorithm will evaluate the probability of a cat being in 
that image.
        
Given x, y^ = P(y = 1| x), where 0 <= y^ <= 1

The parameters used in Logistic regression are:

Some observations from the graph:

- If z is a large positive numner, then sigmoid(z) = 1
- If z is small or large negative number, the sigmoid(z) = 0
- If z = 0, then sigmoid(z) = 0.5
